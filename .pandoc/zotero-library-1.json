  {"id":"fristonDynamicCausalModelling2003","abstract":"In this paper we present an approach to the identification of nonlinear input–state– output systems. By using a bilinear approximation to the dynamics of interactions among states, the parameters of the implicit causal model reduce to three sets. These comprise (1) parameters that mediate the influence of extrinsic inputs on the states, (2) parameters that mediate intrinsic coupling among the states, and (3) [bilinear] parameters that allow the inputs to modulate that coupling. Identification proceeds in a Bayesian framework given known, deterministic inputs and the observed responses of the system. We developed this approach for the analysis of effective connectivity using experimentally designed inputs and fMRI responses. In this context, the coupling parameters correspond to effective connectivity and the bilinear parameters reflect the changes in connectivity induced by inputs. The ensuing framework allows one to characterise fMRI experiments, conceptually, as an experimental manipulation of integration among brain regions (by contextual or trial-free inputs, like time or attentional set) that is revealed using evoked responses (to perturbations or trial-bound inputs, like stimuli). As with previous analyses of effective connectivity, the focus is on experimentally induced changes in coupling (cf., psychophysiologic interactions). However, unlike previous approaches in neuroimaging, the causal model ascribes responses to designed deterministic inputs, as opposed to treating inputs as unknown and stochastic. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

Two di erent models are discussed: (i) a cellular-automata-based model of a nite group with a strong leader where persons can change their opinions but not their spatial positions, and (ii) a model with persons treated as active Brownian particles interacting via a communication eld. In the rst model, two stable phases are possible: a cluster around the leader, and a state of social uni cation. The transition into the second state occurs for a large leader strength and=or for a high level of social noise. In the second model, we nd three stable phases, which correspond either to a “paramagnetic” phase (for high noise and strong di usion), a “ferromagnetic” phase (for small nose and weak di usion), or a phase with spatially separated “domains” (for intermediate conditions). c© 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

  {"id":"izhikevichDynamicalSystemsNeuroscience2006","abstract":"Explains the relationship of electrophysiology, nonlinear dynamics, and the computational properties of neurons, with each concept presented in terms of both neuroscience and mathematics and illustrated using geometrical intuition.\n            In order to model neuronal behavior or to interpret the results of modeling studies, neuroscientists must call upon methods of nonlinear dynamics. This book offers an introduction to nonlinear dynamical systems theory for researchers and graduate students in neuroscience. It also provides an overview of neuroscience for mathematicians who want to learn the basic facts of electrophysiology.\n            Dynamical Systems in Neuroscience presents a systematic study of the relationship of electrophysiology, nonlinear dynamics, and computational properties of neurons. It emphasizes that information processing in the brain depends not only on the electrophysiological properties of neurons but also on their dynamical properties. The book introduces dynamical systems, starting with one- and two-dimensional Hodgkin-Huxley-type models and continuing to a description of bursting systems. Each chapter proceeds from the simple to the complex, and provides sample problems at the end. The book explains all necessary mathematical concepts using geometrical intuition; it includes many figures and few equations, making it especially suitable for non-mathematicians. Each concept is presented in terms of both neuroscience and mathematics, providing a link between the two disciplines.\n            Nonlinear dynamical systems theory is at the core of computational neuroscience research, but it is not a standard part of the graduate neuroscience curriculum—or taught by math or physics department in a way that is suitable for students of biology. This book offers neuroscience students and researchers a comprehensive account of concepts and methods increasingly used in computational neuroscience.\n            An additional chapter on synchronization, with more advanced material, can be found at the author's website, www.izhikevich.com.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Izhikevich","given":"Eugene M."}],"citation-key":"izhikevichDynamicalSystemsNeuroscience2006","DOI":"10.7551/mitpress/2526.001.0001","ISBN":"978-0-262-27607-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",7,21]]},"language":"en","publisher":"The MIT Press","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Dynamical Systems in Neuroscience: The Geometry of Excitability and Bursting","title-short":"Dynamical Systems in Neuroscience","type":"book","URL":"https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/2589/Dynamical-Systems-in-NeuroscienceThe-Geometry-of"},

The Ghost in the Machine looks at the dark side of the coin: our terrible urge to self-destruction... Could the human species be a gigantic evolutionary mistake? To answer that startling question Koestler examines how experts on evolution and psychology all too often write about people with an 'antiquated slot-machine model based on the naively mechanistic world-view of the nineteenth century. His brilliant polemic helped to instigate a major revolution in the life sciences, yet its 'glimpses of an alternative world-view' form only the background to an even more challenging analysis of the human predicament. Perhaps, he suggests, we are a species in which ancient and recent brain structures - or reason and emotion - are not fully co-ordinated. Such in-built deficiencies may explain the paranoia, violence and insanity that are central strands of human history. And however disturbing we find such issues, Koestler contends, it is only when we face our limitations head-on that we can hope to find a remedy.","author":[{"family":"Koestler","given":"Arthur"}],"citation-key":"koestlerGhostMachine2016","event-place":"s.l.","ISBN":"978-1-939438-34-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"eng","number-of-pages":"384","publisher":"Last Century Media","publisher-place":"s.l.","source":"K10plus ISBN","title":"The Ghost in the machine","type":"book"},
